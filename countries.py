The plot method accepts a list of indices, each index is the index of a
country in the list of countries.
From the list of indices, find each corresponding country and plot the 
population of that country for all the years.
Also plot the median population of all the countries in the world, 
for all the years. This helps the user visually compare the population 
of their chosen countries and the median of all countries.
The plot must have: a title, a legend that shows the country names, 
the x-ticks should be the years, â€¨a y-axis label, which is the population in millions.
